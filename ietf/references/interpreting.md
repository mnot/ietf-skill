# Interpreting the IETF/IRTF record

The trigger is grammatical, not a self-assessment: **before you write any
sentence asserting a collective outcome** — settled, decided, agreed,
rejected, "there is consensus," or "the WG thinks/wants" — you should have read
these norms. Reporting what a *named individual* said is free; any claim about
where the *group* landed is gated. Not enforced — the point is to make skipping
the check something you notice choosing, not ordinary efficient judgment. For
the write side — drafting contributions — see [contributing](contributing.md).

## The trap is what you already know

You know the headlines — consensus is chair-declared, not vote-counted;
decisions are confirmed on the list, not made in meetings; participants speak
as individuals, not their employers. That is the trap. The rule that gets lost
isn't a fact you're missing — it's that a discussion *feeling* resolved is not
resolution. When prominent participants converge and the tone goes calm, no one
has decided until a chair declares it on-list or a closed issue records it.
Convergence among vocal participants — even unanimous-sounding — is signal, not
outcome. A session poll (28-4) is a tool to gauge the room, not a decision.
Confidence that the matter is closed is the cue to verify the chair's words,
not to skip the check.

**Worked example.** A draft author raises an objection; a respected
cryptographer posts an analysis answering it; three well-known participants
reply approvingly. Tempting: *"the objection was settled."* Earned: *"the
objection appears answered to the satisfaction of several vocal participants;
no chair has declared it closed, and the draft author was still pressing open
points."* Even a chair's *summary* is weaker evidence than the chair's actual
procedural message — chair characterisations get disputed on-list too. Look for
the chair's actual procedural messages for a thread — the consensus call, WGLC,
or closure — rather than relying on a summary of them.

## Not every decision is called, and none is final until Last Call

Two symmetric mistakes about finality. First, the *absence* of a consensus
call isn't an open issue: chairs don't poll every point, leaving many formally
open as the work proceeds and sweeping them up at **Working Group Last Call
(WGLC)** — the wrap-up that confirms the document whole. Second, a consensus
already declared isn't a closed door — new relevant information (a fresh
implementation report, a security analysis, a use case nobody weighed) can
reopen it at the chair's discretion. Report a past consensus as the current
state of play, not a permanent fact.

And WGLC itself isn't the last word. WG agreement only earns the draft an
**IETF Last Call**, where the whole community — not just WG participants —
weighs in, then IESG review. A group can agree among themselves and still see
the work reshaped or blocked from outside. "The WG agreed" is not "the IETF
agreed"; a document past WGLC but not yet an RFC is still open to wider
scrutiny.

## Affiliation: aggregate, don't attribute

Don't pin a position on a company ("Cloudflare opposes X") from an author's
affiliation — only when they frame it that way ("speaking for X…"). But
implementer signal is real ("rough consensus and running code"), so
*aggregate* instead: "8 of 12 stated supporters ship TLS stacks" is fine;
"Cloudflare supports X" is not, unless they said so. One non-obvious bit:

**Email domain ≠ affiliation.** Participants use personal email and may hold
several affiliations. Rely on stated affiliation data where you have it, never
on the From-header domain.

## Draft names carry structure, not gravity

The prefix is the draft's posture in the process, not its weight:

- **`draft-ietf-<wg>-…`** — adopted by an IETF WG (the segment after `ietf-` is
  the WG shortname). **`draft-irtf-<rg>-…`** — adopted by an IRTF Research Group
  (research, not standards).
- **`draft-<author-id>-…`** — an *individual* submission. The author-id is
  arbitrary, and a hint after it (`draft-rescorla-tls-…`) is unreliable — don't
  infer authorship or WG membership from the filename; check the draft's
  metadata.

**Unadopted drafts have no IETF status** — not a WG document, not
standards-track, no community endorsement. Don't say "the IETF is working on X"
when X is one person's `draft-author-…`.

## Not every RFC is a consensus standard

The stream the draft took determines the endorsement the RFC carries:

- **IETF stream** — WG-adopted, or AD-sponsored for an individual draft: the
  consensus standards track.
- **IRTF stream** — research output, not a standard.
- **Independent Stream (ISE)** — lightweight editorial review, **explicitly not
  a consensus standard**; reading one as "the IETF says…" is wrong.
- **IAB / Editorial streams** — architectural statements / RFC-series process;
  both non-standards.

An RFC number alone doesn't tell you — check the stream and the WG provenance.

## DISPATCH and BoFs are "being considered," not "being worked on"

Proposals rarely land straight in a WG. New work is triaged through the
**DISPATCH** WG (or a domain equivalent that runs its own triage — `httpbis`
for HTTP, `tls` for TLS, `dnsop` for DNS) and explored in one or two **BoF**
sessions before a WG is chartered. A BoF is *not* a WG — no documents, no
consensus authority. So a topic at DISPATCH or a BoF is *being considered*, not
*being worked on*.
