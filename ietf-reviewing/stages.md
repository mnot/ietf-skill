# Reviews of a particular kind

Read the section that applies, at Step 1 of `SKILL.md`. None of this changes the method; it changes
what Step 1 has to establish before the method starts.

## Directorate reviews

Directorate reviews are usually made at the IETF Last Call stage. An *early* directorate review is
different: they are requested for in-progress WG documents, and focus on whether any blocking
problems are anticipated.

**Look the request up rather than waiting to be handed it.** It carries the team, the review type,
the deadline, whether anyone has claimed it, and usually a note from the AD or chair.

```
https://datatracker.ietf.org/api/v1/review/reviewrequest/?doc__name=draft-...&format=json
```

Use `doc__name`. The obvious `?doc=` returns `{"error": "Invalid resource lookup data provided
(mismatched type)."}`, which reads like an empty result and will convince you there is no request.

What the reviewer asked for still governs: the lookup informs, it does not repick the question.
Where the request contradicts the brief -- an *early* review filed against a document they described
as being at Last Call -- say so and ask.

Check the team's wiki page for guidelines and requirements: where there are any, they say what that
team wants looked at. Directorates are listed at <https://datatracker.ietf.org/review/>, and the
datatracker "about" page for a team links its wiki. Any review form there is for the writing step,
if a review gets written at all.

**The lane is declared, so scope to it.** Step 4's default -- when unsure, dispatch, because a
wasted lens costs little -- was written for an open-ended review. On a directorate assignment the
cost has moved rather than grown: the lenses still run in parallel, so what you spend is output
volume and your own synthesis, not wall clock. Scope each dispatch to the team's lane and require it
to *route* what falls outside rather than develop it.

**Do not cut the lens set to the lane.** The lens that fires outside it is often where the in-lane
finding hides. Rule a lens out on its own
`Firing` section, as always; never on the team's remit. `delivering.md`'s *A declared scope is
permeable* depends on this: you cannot flag the out-of-lane point at delivery if you never ran the
lens that found it.

Whether the adjacent lanes are covered is checkable rather than assumable. Grep the group's other
documents for `secdir|genart|artart|opsdir` -- a WG that routinely gets the full set is a different
situation from one where this is the only review the document will see before Last Call.

## Revisions of a published document (bis)

Establish what the document obsoletes or updates. Diff against each of those, not only against the
previous revision.

Check the standing-document graph. A BCP or STD usually holds several RFCs; obsoleting some leaves
the rest in place, still referencing what was replaced.

Treat a missing changes section as a finding.

Compare requirement strength keyword by keyword. A MUST restated as a declarative sentence is a
weakening no prose diff shows.

Ask where every deleted requirement went. Where the document says it now lives elsewhere -- a
registry, another RFC -- fetch that and confirm it is there.

## Revisions answering a closed review round

Where the current revision was written to answer a round that has closed -- a WGLC, a directorate
review, an IESG ballot -- do two things before anything else.

Diff it against the revision the round read. New text has been reviewed by nobody, and a document
answering reviews is where new text arrives.

Which revision that is comes from Step 1's review record, and there is usually more than one:
reviews and ballot positions in a single round are cast against different revisions, and the earliest
of them bounds what "reviewed" covers. Diff against that one, not against the round's closing date.

Check what was agreed and did not land. A closed issue or an approved pull request that never merged
is invisible from the document.

**The other direction is more common: the repo is ahead of the datatracker.** Everything merged,
nothing published. Diff the published revision against `main` and read the commits since.

**A review is of one document.** Where the two have diverged materially and the request does not say
which, stop and ask. Do not review both, and do not pick for them -- a review of the wrong revision
is wasted, and which one they want is not inferable from the draft.

Once the target is settled, note a *substantive* change with no issue, pull request or thread behind
it as context, not as a process complaint: the WG may not know it moved. It belongs in the covering
message, never in a filed issue -- there it reads as a complaint about the editors however it is
worded.

## Post-IESG approval

**Past IESG approval, sort findings by route rather than by severity.** "Is there a blocking
problem?" is calibrated to a decision already taken: answer no and the review says nothing, answer
yes and you are asking for a recall, which is a cost borne by people other than you. The three
routes are AUTH48 or an RFC Editor note; pulling the document back; and an erratum or the next
revision. Say which one each finding is for.
