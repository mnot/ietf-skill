# Delivering the review

The optional, second half of `SKILL.md`. Read it only when the reviewer asks for output, after they
have chosen what to raise, and only on what they chose. Nothing here should reach back and change a
finding.

Two shapes -- prose, or issues against the draft's repo. Both begin with `ietf-contributing`, both
rely on the findings rather than re-verifying them, and in both the human sends.


## Writing the review

Rely on the findings. The quotes were verified at Step 8 and re-checking them here buys nothing but
delay -- the reviewer is waiting, and friction here is what stops them asking next time.

This does not conflict with `ietf-contributing`'s rule against citing what you cannot retrieve. A
Step 8 quote in the findings *is* retrieved text; that rule is against reconstructing a citation
from memory. Do not read it as licence to re-verify.

The exception is narrow: if the Step 8 verification was not yours, because the findings came from a
context you did not audit, say so once and let the reviewer decide. Say it -- do not silently
re-derive, which spends their time to answer a question they were not asked.

Read `ietf-contributing` first. It governs register, disclosure, and what the sender has to be able
to defend.

Get the conventional form from a recent real review of the type you are writing -- for a
directorate, one by that team; for a Last Call comment, one from the last-call list. The headings
below are the directorate convention and will not always fit.

Do not hard-wrap it. Mail clients and archives reflow, and hard breaks survive into quoted replies
as ragged fragments. Leave each prose paragraph on one line. Quoted draft or RFC text keeps the
source's own line breaks and indentation -- it is verbatim, and reflowing it changes it.

The review is a selection from the findings, not a rendering of them: it usually carries fewer
issues than the findings hold. Cut on relevance to the audience and the stage, not to a number.
Plain headings -- `Issues`, `Comments`, `Nits` -- carrying only what was chosen.

### Open with the verdict

Open with the disposition, in one or two sentences, answering the Step 1 question. Then
the concerns.

Do not open with methodology or a summary of the draft. A line of genuine thanks before the verdict
is often conventional in directorate reviews; what to avoid is praise standing in for a verdict, or
warmth calibrated to soften one.

State the concession after the verdict, not instead of it. *This should not be picked up in its
current state, though something of roughly this shape might be* is a verdict. *Here are some
concerns* is not.

**A favourable verdict is valid.** *This is fine, and here are two things worth clarifying* carries
the same obligation to say why -- usually by naming what the document is for. Do not bury approval
under the findings, do not phrase it as the absence of objections, and do not let a run of
clarifications imply a severity the disposition does not support.

On a directorate review the disposition also goes in the datatracker `Result` field, and that is
one of: `Ready`, `Ready with Nits`, `Ready with Issues`, `Almost Ready`, `On the Right Track`, `Not
Ready`. Pick the result the document earns; the prose verdict should say the same thing the field
does.

**Do not copy all finding contents** -- keep what's relevant to the review type being created. In
particular *severity* and *confidence* are intended for the reviewer, not the review.

**Decline whole categories out loud** rather than skipping silently: "I'll skip editorial issues
given the state of the text."

**A declared scope is permeable.** Reviewers announce a lane and then say the important thing
anyway, flagging it -- "this is for the security directorate, but". If a finding matters and sits
just outside the scope you declared, say it and mark it out of lane.

### Cut what does not earn its place

A short review means the document is fine or it is hopeless; the long ones are the salvageable
middle. Use that as a sanity check on where yours sits, not as a budget.

The test is per-sentence: *would removing this change what the recipient does?* If not, cut it.
Over-length comes from padding the argument, not from having found a lot of things. Three patterns
produce most of it:

- **Justifying the finding to the reviewer** -- why this is an issue rather than a nit, why it is
  worth raising. That was the findings' job and it is done.
- **Pre-empting the authors at length.** A clause where their best objection changes the ask;
  otherwise nothing.
- **Quoting past what the argument uses, then restating the quote in prose.** Trim the quote to what
  the sentence turns on, and let it stand.

Delete prose. Do not delete defects. A finding the reviewer chose to raise stays in, even if the
prose around it goes.

### Final pass

Double check the review for each of these:

- Is each claim about the **document** or about the **topic**? Cut comments on the topic.
- Does the quoted text actually support the claim made about it?
- Does anything read as position-taking without reference to what the document says? Cut it.
- Have you answered the Step 1 question, in the first two sentences, unambiguously?

## Filing issues

The other output shape, in a group that runs its draft from a repo.

**One at a time, confirmed before each.** Show the reviewer the exact text -- title and body -- and
file it only when they have approved that one. Never file a batch on a single approval, and never
file ahead while they are still reading. Approval of one is not approval of the next.

### Search the tracker first

Every finding, against open and closed issues both, before drafting any of them. For anything about
text that changed, Step 8's `git log -S` walk finds the right issue where a keyword search will not.

- **Already open.** Comment there. Do not file again.
- **Closed, and the reasoning holds.** Drop the finding. Step 9 asked this; the tracker is where the
  answer is.
- **Closed, and the change agreed in it never landed in the text.** Reopen it. A new issue loses the
  thread that agreed the fix.
- **The position was argued and rejected.** Reframing to a different ask is fair; refiling the same
  one is not. Say in the issue that you have read the earlier thread.

### What gets filed as what

| | Issue | Pull request |
|---|---|---|
| **Issue** | one each | rarely -- see below |
| **Comment** | always, ganged or not | optional, where the answer is not in doubt |
| **Nit** | no | yes, chunked into coherent batches |

A nit whose fix requires choosing between two options is a comment. *These two spellings differ* is
a nit only if you can say which one goes.

Comments stand alone where each names a section and has a determinate answer, and gang where they
are editorial or cluster on one section. Twenty filed separately bury the issues; that is what to
weigh it against.

Each issue carries its own context -- the revision, the section, the quotes. There is no covering
message and no shared thread, so nothing may refer to the findings or to "the review".

### What transfers

*The case* and *Can be resolved if* go over almost verbatim. *Related* and *Caused by* become issue
links, which is the one thing the tracker does better than prose. *Confidence* and *Grounding* do
not ship; they were for the reviewer.

**Label the editorial ones.** Repos commonly carry an `editorial` label for issues that need no WG
discussion; check `gh label list` and apply it where it exists. It is how the chairs keep the
substantive list readable.

### Pull requests

Only where the fix is not a decision -- the Step 9 survivability test again. If the text follows
from something already settled, a pull request saves a round trip. If the fix embodies the decision,
it front-runs the group and belongs in an issue.

**A pull request against an Issue is a signal you misranked it.** An Issue is a finding where the
authors have to decide something first; if you can write the text yourself, the decision was already
made, and it was a Comment.

Open the issue first for anything substantive and reference it from the pull request. Substantive
text arriving as a pull request with nothing behind it is the pattern Step 1 tells you to flag; do
not create it.

### The verdict has nowhere to go

A tracker has no slot for the Step 1 answer, and a set of issues without one reads as nits whatever
is in them. It goes in a covering message to the list, the ballot, or the Last Call comment. Say
which, rather than letting it drop.
